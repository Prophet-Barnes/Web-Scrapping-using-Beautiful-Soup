20 June 2021,Verified buyer,3.0,After replacement..now better,"  Few issues are resolved that are mention below..but still this mobile hasn't the charm of OnePlus..It is like a normal android..not an OnePlus..Low processing, Exceptional features of OnePlus are not there in this phone..Took so long time to delete items..Battery is draining fast..Charging is not as fast as claimed..Earlier I was using OnePlus 5T..I bought it to upgrade but unfortunately it degrades..."
20 June 2021,Rohit M,4.0,Good overall,  The best part of the phone is it's super simple and user friendly operating system. Camera doesn't oversaturate colours and captures decent photos. Battery charging is super fast. People argue that this is overpriced in this segment but I guess ease of using the phone and mainly the OS wouldn't be so good in other comparable phones. It is super light and handy.Edit: taking away 1 star from the review after a month's usage.Phone app lags all the time. Phone starts ringing when I receive a call while the name of caller appears 5 seconds later. This is very annoying. Similar issue while calling. Hope some software update fixes this issue.
20 June 2021,Omar khan,1.0,Worst phone in this segment,  Phone looks good but features are 10k phoneCamera is worstPerformance is not goodI recommend to go like vivo or oppo
20 June 2021,Subhrajit Pyne,5.0,Smooth user experience,"  Performance is really good - no lags at allPerfectly smooth user experience.COD gaming - quality medium, frame rate max - fps 57-60.Quality high, max frame rate - fps - 45-58Battery easily lasts more than one day with 1 hour gaming and 2-3 hours YouTube/Netflix etc.Super fast charging.Cameras are good too.Not as good as pixel 4a but almost 90% as good.Single speaker is a let down, but still enough loud.No ois but software stabilization is good.Overall, very satisfied with the phone.Really enjoying using the phone.Simply trust OnePlus, they know how to make good phones."
20 June 2021,Myra,1.0,Disappointed due to camera,"  23 jun-Update after using almost 4 days,Front camera sucks, I have changed my phone after 3 years and ut is 24k phone which doesn't even have nice front camera, there is too much lag in front camera, you will have to stay steady (atleast 30 secs)to have nice selfie, if you are someone who is looking to change the phone for camera then just think about it, selfie camera is going to give you headache especially in indoor light, I can write pages about its worst camera performance. Rear camera works fine, no issues with that but front oneðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, my money just got wasted.19 Jun- By look, it is awesome, feels good in hand, light weight but I personally wanted a good camera which it doesn't have especially selfie camera, not happy with the front camera, rear camera is fine, not that bad."
20 June 2021,Sunil Pareek,5.0,the best ðŸ¤ž,"  My first impression was overwhelming as it was a major upgrade from my last phone. It's a piece of art, the glass body and the amoled display makes feel.. Terrific.. ðŸ˜… One thing to take extra care is the camera portion which is placed Protruding at the back . The case is of average quality. The phone is butter smooth ðŸ¤¤ It's just been a few hours so hoping for the best ðŸ¤ž"
20 June 2021,sayyad awez,5.0,Best under 25k range,"  Awesome phone, amazing camera, better than nord, charcoal colour is looking premium, best option under 25k. Go for it."
20 June 2021,Dhiren Punjabi,5.0,Buy if software performance matters most to you.,"  So far, so good. While the omission of the alert slider is baffling, everything else seems good for the price. Oxygen OS and good service of OnePlus is the saving grace, else there are better specifications out there. Buy it if software performance is your number 1 priority. Else you can get better phones from Redmi, iQoo or others."
20 June 2021,sumit s.,1.0,Worst mobile,"  Worst mobile, dont waste your hard earn money on this pathetic device.."
